#In this project, I developed a predictive model to identify the factors contributing to employee attrition. By analyzing the dataset and using machine learning techniques, we can gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention. 💼📊🔍

Here is an overview of the key steps and techniques used in the project:

  1  Data Processing and Exploration:
        -Loaded the dataset and gained an understanding of its structure.
        -Checked for missing values, unique values, and performed descriptive statistics.
        -Encoded categorical variables using label encoding.

  2  Data Analysis and Visualization:
        -Analyzed the distribution and count of attrition instances.
        -Calculated the attrition percentage to evaluate the overall attrition rate.
        -Conducted statistical analysis to identify the key attributes influencing attrition.
        -Visualized the attributes contributing the most to attrition using bar charts.

  3  Model Building and Evaluation:
        -Prepared the dataset for training and testing.
        -Built a Random Forest classifier model to predict employee attrition.
        -Evaluated the model's accuracy and analyzed the confusion matrix.

The model achieved an accuracy of 87%, indicating its effectiveness in predicting employee attrition. 📈✅
